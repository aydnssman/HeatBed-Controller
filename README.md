# HeatBed Controller

This project was made to keep the standard heat bed constant at the desired temperature in a closed environment (such as an oven) and to measure the temperature inside.

New updates are coming soon...  :)

## Used Components

1.  Arduino Uno

2.  5 x (100 K NTC & 10 K Resistor) 

3.  Potantiometer

4.  IRF44N MOSFET & BC235 Transistor

5.  1N4001 Diode

6.  12 V 10 A Dc Voltage Source 

7.  Heat Bed

It was designed open source with [ugurbayezit](https://github.com/ugurbayezit).
