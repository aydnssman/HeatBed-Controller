# HeatBed Controller

It is made to ensure that the standard heat bed remains constant at the desired temperature.

The following system has also been installed in order to control the heat bed temperature depending on the heat bed.

## Used Components

1.  Arduino Uno

2.  5 x (100 K NTC & 10 K Resistor) 

3.  Potantiometer

4.  IRF44N MOSFET & BC235 Transistor

5.  1N4001 Diode

6.  12 V 10 A Dc Voltage Source 

7.  Heat Bed

It was designed open source with [ugurbayezit](https://github.com/ugurbayezit).
